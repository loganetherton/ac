### User Types
This document describes the different user types available on the Appraisal Scope platform.

#### Super Admin
The _Super Admin_ is a special user having full administrative access to the Appraisal Scope platform. Only one Super Admin account can be created per sub. The Super Admin account is also used by Appraisal Scope developers and management for diagnostic purposes. The Super Admin account is invisible to the sub.

##### How Are Super Admin Accounts Created?
The Super Admin account can only be created during the sub's account setup phase.

##### v1 Sample Access
Access can be found in [User Type Access](https://github.com/ascope/manuals/blob/master/Developer's%20Guide/Guidelines/Overview/User%20Type%20Access.md).

#### Admin/Staff
The Appraisal Scope platform is primarily designed to accommodate the workflow of [AMC](https://github.com/ascope/manuals/blob/master/Developer's%20Guide/Guidelines/Overview/Glossary.md)s and lenders. Internally, we refer to Appraisal Scope Subscribers as [subs](https://github.com/ascope/manuals/blob/master/Developer's%20Guide/Guidelines/Overview/Glossary.md). Staff members of these subs will be given _Admin/Staff_ access.

##### How Are Admin/Staff Accounts Created?
- Login to [Super Admin account](https://github.com/ascope/manuals/blob/master/Developer's%20Guide/Guidelines/Overview/User%20Type%20Access.md).
- Click on the `STAFF` tab, `Staff` sub-tab.
- Under the `Create New Admin` section, new admin/staff accounts can be created. [Screenshot](http://screencast.com/t/1qGxitew).

Access can be found in [User Type Access](https://github.com/ascope/manuals/blob/master/Developer's%20Guide/Guidelines/Overview/User%20Type%20Access.md).   

#### Client
_Clients_ are typically banks or lenders who submit new appraisals to subs. Subs will then complete the appraisals and submit appraisal reports back to the clients.
  
##### How Are Client Accounts Created?
The Client View is typically used by sub users created under client companies. The client company itself will not usually sign in to the client view.

There are three methods for creating a client company in the Appraisal Scope platform:

1. Using the `CLIENT SIGN UP` tab on the Appraisal Scope login screen.
2. By creating a new company using the Admin/Staff View.
  * Log in to the [Admin/Staff View](https://github.com/ascope/manuals/blob/master/Developer's%20Guide/Guidelines/Overview/User%20Type%20Access.md).
  * Go to the `USERS` tab, `CLIENT` sub-tab.
  * Select `NEW COMPANY`. [Screenshot](http://screencast.com/t/yIWrumxacWt1).
3. By importing client companies using the Admin View.
  * Log in to the [Admin/Staff View](https://github.com/ascope/manuals/blob/master/Developer's%20Guide/Guidelines/Overview/User%20Type%20Access.md).
